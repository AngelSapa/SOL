            <h2>Nutrition and Food Security</h2>
            <p>Access to nutritious food is a basic human right. SOL's Nutrition pillar is focused on creating sustainable food systems that provide healthy, locally-grown food to communities. We work to empower people to grow their own food, participate in community gardens, and gain access to organic produce.</p>
            
            <h3>Sustainable Farming</h3>
            <p>Our programs promote organic farming practices that prioritize environmental sustainability and food security. By teaching communities how to grow their own food, we help reduce reliance on expensive grocery stores and encourage self-sufficiency.</p>

            <h3>Community Gardens</h3>
            <p>Community gardens are at the heart of our Nutrition initiative. These spaces not only provide fresh produce but also serve as places for education and social connection, where neighbors come together to share knowledge and resources.</p>
