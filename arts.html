            <h2>Arts and Crafts</h2>
            <p>Art is a powerful form of expression and communication. At SOL, we believe that artistic expression is key to building vibrant, resilient communities. The Arts and Crafts pillar focuses on nurturing creative outlets such as writing, painting, dancing, music, and traditional crafts that reflect the culture and history of the community.</p>
            
            <h3>Creative Spaces</h3>
            <p>We offer community spaces where people can come together to practice and explore their creativity. These spaces host workshops, performances, and exhibits that allow community members to express themselves and learn new skills in a supportive environment.</p>

            <h3>Cultural Revitalization</h3>
            <p>Through our Arts and Crafts programs, we aim to preserve and revive cultural traditions. We provide opportunities for artisans and creatives to share their crafts with younger generations, ensuring that these skills and stories continue to thrive within the community.</p>
