            <h2>Housing and Affordable Living</h2>
            <p>Housing is a critical part of ensuring a sustainable future. At SOL, we focus on creating affordable, eco-friendly housing solutions that empower communities to take control of their living spaces. We work with natural materials, like cob, to build homes that are both cost-effective and environmentally friendly.</p>
            
            <h3>Sustainable Building</h3>
            <p>Our approach to housing emphasizes the use of natural and locally-sourced materials. Cob building is one of the many techniques we teach in workshops to create durable, aesthetically pleasing homes at a fraction of the cost of traditional construction.</p>

            <h3>Community Ownership</h3>
            <p>We believe in collective ownership of land and housing. Our model promotes stewardship, where communities take care of the land, making housing an asset for all members rather than a financial burden for individuals.</p>
